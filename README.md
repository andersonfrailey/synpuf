# synpuf
Synthetic PUF

Repository in relation to constructing a fully synthetic PUF database from the actual PUF. (Public Use File -- from the IRS Statistics of Income branch.) Purpose is to allow interested OSPC members to communicate about issues and methods for constructing a fully synthetic PUF. We will not have any confidential or non-releasable data on this site.

This repo also includes the `synpuf` Python package which preprocesses the PUF file for synthesis and analysis via the [`synthimpute`](https://github.com/MaxGhenis/synthimpute/tree/master/synthimpute) package.

Interested OSPC members are likely to include [@andersonfrailey](https://github.com/andersonfrailey), [@feenberg](https://github.com/feenberg), [@MaxGhenis](https://github.com/MaxGhenis), and [@MattHJensen](https://github.com/MattHJensen).

I've set this up in my github user account for now but we can transfer it to an OSPC account whenever that makes sense.
